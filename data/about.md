Seascapes are dynamic classifications of water masses based on sea surface properties derived from satellite imagery. The MPA Monitoring Service app was developed by [Adriano Lima (AIR Centre)](https://www.aircentre.org/people/), modifed from the original [Seascapes for Sanctuaries app](https://shiny.marinebon.app/seascapes/).
